VH1’s ‘Man of the Year’ and ‘Top 40 Hottest Men of the 90s’.</span></p><p><span>The model’s growing network has seen him represented by international agencies like D’Management Group in Milan and Soul Artist Management from his home state of New York.</span></p><p><span>Tyson Beckford has also had a decent career as a television personality.&nbsp;One of his earliest roles in the role was in 2003, when he took part in ABC’s celebrity reality game contest&nbsp;</span><span>I’m a Celebrity…Get Me Out of Here!&nbsp;</span><span>He is also a strong advocate for the need to eliminate domestic violence.&nbsp;In 2008, he worked with giverespect.org on the&nbsp;</span><span>national RESPECT!&nbsp;</span><span>campaign, to record a sound addressing the relevance of mutual respect.</span></p><p><span>Perhaps his biggest TV involvement was with the TV modeling contest,&nbsp;</span><span>Make Me a Model</span><span>&nbsp;on Bravo Channel, where he co-anchored the show’s first season with fellow model Niki Taylor.&nbsp;For the following season, Beckford also acted as a mentor for the contestants, along with Nicole Trunfio and a few other notables from the fashion world.&nbsp;He also took part in the Australian spin-off of the modeling show with former Miss Universe Jennifer Hawkins.</span></p><p><span>As an actor, the model’s film portfolio dates back to 2000. It was in this year that Tyson Beckford made his film debut with an appearance in the film.&nbsp;</span><span>Boricua’s link.&nbsp;</span><span>Since then, he has participated in many films, including&nbsp;</span><span>Zoolander</span><span>&nbsp;(2001)&nbsp;</span><span>;&nbsp;Evening Kings</span><span>&nbsp;(2007)&nbsp;</span><span>;&nbsp;</span><span>and&nbsp;</span><span>Supermodel</span><span>&nbsp;(2016).</span></p><p><span>Beckford’s music portfolio also includes appearances in music videos such as Mariah Carey, 50 Cent, Ludacris, Britney Spears, DJ Khaled and many more.</span></p><p><span>Tyson Beckford decided to get more serious with his spirituality after escaping a terrible car accident in 2005 while driving his car in New Jersey.&nbsp;He appeared on&nbsp;</span><span>The Oprah Winfrey Show</span><span>&nbsp;shortly after the incident to discuss his ordeal</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=tyson-beckfords-family-parents-wife-berniece-julien-son></span><strong><span>Tyson Beckford’s Family: Parents, Wife (Berniece Julien), Son</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Everyone’s beauty comes from somewhere and it’s no different for the American model.&nbsp;Tyson Beckford is the definition of exotic when it comes to the genes responsible for his appearance.&nbsp;He was born to a Chinese mother of Jamaican descent and an Afro-Jamaican father, Lloyd Beckford of Panama.</span></p><p><span>It was his mother, Hillary Dixon Hall, who moved Tyson and the rest of the family to Jamaica, where the young boy spent the first seven years of his life.</span></p><p><span>As an adult, he’s had his share of relationships that aren’t surprising to someone with his reputation and physical attractiveness.&nbsp;Beckford’s dating history can be traced to names like Shanina Shaik and reality TV personality April Roomet.&nbsp;Beckford shares a child with the latter from their time together.&nbsp;His son, Jordan Beckford, was born in 1998.</span></p><p><span>Tyson is said to be married to Berniece Julien.&nbsp;The details of their marriage remain largely a mystery, however, the two have been together for a number of years.&nbsp;As of 2018, no children have resulted from the relationship.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-tyson-beckford-gay></span><strong><span>Is Tyson Beckford gay?</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>You may think that’s an absurd assumption, giving his heterosexual dating portfolio.&nbsp;However, that’s hardly a surprise for a man who has made his living with his body for most of his career.</span></p><p><span>On August 1, 2018, the model went into an online fight with reality TV star Kim Kardashian after she commented on a photo she posted on Twitter, insinuating that she had often gone under the knife and that she had had a false look.&nbsp;Kim took revenge by addressing her a feminine pronoun.&nbsp;Many Twitter users chided him, calling his response homophobic.</span></p><p><span>Beckford then went on to reinforce her aversion to aesthetic beauty while affirming her support for the LGBTQ community.&nbsp;Beckford has also made it clear that he is as straight as he can get.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKypqLyvecGemqSen6exbq7IqJ6rmaCdxm7DyJ%2BcZpqVp7uqscKeZKOtnJ6yr3nSqKVmqJGnsq%2FA0magrGWYmnqordho</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-alyssa-arce-the-untold-truth-of-miss-playboy-wiki-517511-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Alyssa Arce?
