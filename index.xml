To explain: Reitman directed, and Murray starred in, the enormously successful “Meatballs,” which was an entertaining enough comedy but awfully ragged. No wonder.

The infected monsters in “The Sadness” not only run, curse, and verbally threaten everyone else—their violence also inadvertently highlights the ugly, amoral nature of various fight or flight responses.&amp;nbsp;
Like a lot of disaster movies, “The Sadness” only superficially concerns the reunification of two lovers: Jim (Berant Zhu) and Kat (Regina Lei) try to get back together after a spike in the mysterious Alvin virus separates them and also compels various infected victims to commit random acts of murder, torture, and sexual assault.</description></item><item><title>Why Zach Bryan and Deb Peifer Called It Quits: A Closer Look at Their Breakup - SarkariResult</title><link>/why-zach-bryan-and-deb-peifer-called-it-quits-a-closer-look-at-their-breakup.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/why-zach-bryan-and-deb-peifer-called-it-quits-a-closer-look-at-their-breakup.html</guid><description>News: On May 31, 2023, country singer Zach Bryan made a heartfelt announcement revealing the end of his relationship with girlfriend Deb Peifer.
