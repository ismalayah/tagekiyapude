She was considered to be the medium of success for the Lakers. She became famous after HBO started the feature story called The Winning Time: The Rise of Lakers, where the role of Claire was fulfilled by the Emmy-nominated actress Baby Hoffmann.</p><h3>Early Life</h3><p>Claire Rothman was brought up in Las Vegas and is 93 years old as of her birth in 1929. It is not known who her parents are because she never said a word about her parents to the media. Also, it is not known who are the siblings of Claire Rothman because of similar reasons.</p><h3>Claire Rothman Career</h3><p>She was appointed by the former Lakers’ owner Jack Kent Cooke in 1975. She quickly rose to fame and became the general manager and president of The Forum arena where the Lakers played. Without Claire’s permission, the showtime of the Lakers was not allowed until she used to give her agreement to the timings. She was the main body behind the 80s working of the Lakers and their success.</p><p>Claire kept Lakers in the existence of light, and the media on at the Forum. She was the main reason behind keeping the tickets flowing in the stadium even when the sports were not scheduled for the day in the arena. She was the person behind making things possible for the Lakers and keeping them intact with the media and their entertainment in the news.</p><h4>Rise to Fame</h4><p>Before joining The Forum by the former owner Jack Kent Cooke in 1975, Claire worked in Florida and Ohio. She was the reason behind his meeting of Jack with Jerry Buss. The meeting led the Lakers to achieve one of the most significant sales in franchise sports history. Claire came in touch with many artists, including Prince and Duran, keeping the happiness of the Lakers intact and maintaining the position in the industry.</p><p>According to the sources, Claire began her career in 1986 while working as Past President at the Trusteeship where she worked until 1989 stretching the work for around three years. Likewise, she worked as the President and General Manager for the Great Western Forum from January 1975 to May 1995. Later after marriage, Claire started working with her husband, managing the finances of the company and thinking about the expenses. Once she saw the divorce from her first husband, she worked for The Forum and then married again to her next husband with whom she has been living for 38 years.</p><table><tbody><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Claire Rothman Biography</h3></th></tr><tr><td width=40%>Real Name</td><td width=60%>Claire L Rothman</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Date</td><td>1929</td></tr><tr><td>Age (as of 2022)</td><td>93 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Place</td><td>United States</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>General Manager of the Lakers</td></tr><tr><td>Religion</td><td>Christianity</td></tr><tr><td>Sun sign</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Physical Statistics</h3></th></tr><tr><td colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Claire-Rothman-2.jpg alt width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>in feet inches&nbsp;<strong>– 5’ 5” – </strong>in Centimeters <strong>– 165 cm</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>in Kilograms&nbsp;<strong>– 53 kg&nbsp; –&nbsp; </strong>in Pounds&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp; 116 lbs</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Shoe Size</td><td>6 (U.S.)</td></tr><tr><td>Hair Color</td><td>Light Brown</td></tr><tr><td>Eye Color</td><td>Dark Brown</td></tr><tr><td>Body Type</td><td>Average</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Family</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Father</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Mother</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Sister</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Brother</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Qualification/Education</h3></th></tr><tr><td>School</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>College</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Relationship Status</h3></th></tr><tr><td colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Claire-Rothman-3.jpg alt width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td>Divorced</td></tr><tr><td>Who is her husband?</td><td>Edwin Hill</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Two</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Personal Life</h3><p>Claire Rothman married soon after completing high school and later she skipped college choosing to work with her husband rather than searching by herself. The couple together produced two children- one daughter and one son. On the other hand, Claire put her efforts to raise the position of her husband’s company. She was married to her husband for around 20 years, handled the records of the company, had all major events in the hotels and hospitals in Philadelphia and Atlantic City as the customers took charge of the finance, and worked all the time.</p><p>After the divorce from her first husband, Clair took her job at The Forum which she continued till 1995. She took another role as Ticketmaster before seemingly returning in 1999 after retiring from The Forum. Since then, she has appeared on various forums and companies like the Music Center of Los Angeles County.&nbsp; Now, living in her 90s, Claire is enjoying her adulthood and her living style with her only husband Edwin Hill, with whom she is living in Las Vegas, Nevada, and have been together for around four decades.</p><h4>Life after her first divorce</h4><p>After seeing the threads of the split in her marriage, the divorce was finalized in 1976 and Claire began working for a Spectrum arena as a bookkeeper in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. There at the company, she was promoted to the position of a business manager within a year and a half. Claire’s work with her ex-husband gave her an advantage over here when she decided to turn her job into another profile. On one side, she was handling her house bills and on the other side, she was handling the thousands of data for the electric expenses in the Spectrum. The astonishing thing was not that she was performing all these roles but it was that she had a great hand in the business of her ex-husband that helped her to grow in her later life.</p><h3>Claire Rothman Net Worth</h3><p>Claire Rothman produces an estimated net worth of around $1.5 million because of her former collaborations with the companies and the associations. She still gets paid by the various companies and organizations giving her individuality and a name in the world.</p><span class=simplesocialtxt>Facebook</span> <span class=simplesocialtxt>Twitter</span> <span class=simplesocialtxt>Reddit</span> <span class=simplesocialtxt>WhatsApp</span> <span class=simplesocialtxt>Pinterest</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZa5tbTYrKeyZpOkunCvy5qgq51dp7y1tMyapWg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./nathan-lane-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nathan Lane Net Worth">&larr;
