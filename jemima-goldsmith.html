She is also the owner of the television production company<i> Instinct Productions</i> (founded in <i>2015</i>).</p><p>Jemima formerly worked as the European editor-at-large for the American magazine <i>Vanity Fair</i>. Moreover, she served as a journalist and associate editor for<i> The New Statesman</i>, a British political and cultural publication, and <i>British Vogue</i>.</p><h2>Jemima Goldsmith's Married Life With Pakistani Prime Minister</h2><p>Jemima Goldsmith was previously married to<strong>&nbsp;Imran Khan</strong>, a 22nd and current Prime Minister and cricketer of Pakistan, in 1995 after dating for few years.

The media used the phrase<i> "wedding of the century"</i> to describe the event.</p><p>Moreover, the ex-pair shared two kids from their relationship. The duo lived a happy life with their sons, but unfortunately, their connection did not work well. As a result, they separated and got divorced in<i> 2004</i>.</p><h2>How Many Children Does Jemima Goldsmith Have?</h2><p>Jemima Goldsmith has two sons from her marriage with Imran khan. The ex-partner welcomed a son,&nbsp;<strong>Sulaiman Isa Khan</strong>&nbsp;as their first child on <i>November 18, 1996</i>.

After the divorce, Jemima and Khan shared their sons' custody.</p><p>Moreover, the CEO of Instinct Productions frequently shares photographs of her kids on her social account like Instagram and Twitter.
